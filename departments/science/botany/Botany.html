      <h4>Profile</h4>
      <p>
        The Department of Botany was established at the college in the academic year 1993‚Äì94 when the Arts subject courses of the undergraduate wing of University College were shifted to the Kariavattom campus. In 1996, undergraduate courses were transferred back to University College, and new vocational programs including Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Computer Science, and Statistics were introduced. Consequently, the college was renamed Government College Kariavattom in 1997. By 1998, the Geography course was introduced, followed by restructured double-main combinations such as Physics & Computer Application and Chemistry & Industrial Chemistry in 1999.
